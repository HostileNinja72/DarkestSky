# Darkest Sky

This Project represents the convergence of my passion for astronomy with the craft of programming. It servers as a dynamic project where i apply scientific knowledge from astronomy and geography through sophisticated programming techniques.

The project is in active development, and it evolves with each new implementation and a learning of mine.
While comprehensive documentation is still under construction, the repository will be updated regularly with new features and refinements. The forthcoming documentation will offer a deep dive into the functionalities, setup, and usage of the Darkest Sky software.
